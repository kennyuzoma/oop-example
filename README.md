# OOP Example - "Artist contract application"

## Description

Each user is an artist that wants to sign a contract with another songwriter. Here we solve this problem using PHP.

## Disclaimer

This is codebase serves as an example of my use of OOP.
Laravel was used as the base for encryption purposes and not having to reinvent the wheel. **For the purposes of this example, most of the laravel related code has been removed to showcase my code.** Even though Laravel is the base, the practices, classes, methods (the overall manner in which I code) can still follow vanilla OOP standards.

Please let me know if more examples are needed.
